<h3>Do you provide tracking information?</h3>
<p>Yes, you will receive an email once your order ships that contains your tracking information. If you haven’t received tracking info within 5 days, please contact us.</p>
<h3>My tracking says “no information available at the moment”.</h3>
<p>For some shipping companies, it takes 2-5 business days for the tracking information to update on the system.	If your order was placed more than 5 business days ago and there is still no information on your tracking number, please contact us.</p>
<h3>Will my items be sent in one package?</h3>
<p>For logistical reasons, items in the same purchase will sometimes be	sent in separate packages, even if you&#8217;ve specified combined shipping.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions, please contact us and we will do our best to help you out.</p>
