<b>How do you ship packages?</b></br></br>

<b>Do you ship worldwide?</b></br></br>
<p>Yes. We provide free shipping to over 200 countries around the world. However, there are some locations we are unable to ship to. If you happen to be located in one of those countries we will contact you.</p>

<b>What about customs?</b></br></br>
<p>We are not responsible for any custom fees once the items have shipped. By purchasing our products, you consent that one or more packages may be shipped to you and may get custom fees when they arrive to your country.</p>

<b>How long does shipping take?</b></br></br>
<p>Shipping time varies by location. These are our estimates:<p>

<p>Location	*Estimated Shipping Time</p>
<p>United States 	10-20 Business days</p>

<p>*This doesn’t include our 2-5 day processing time.</p>

<b>Do you provide tracking information?</b></br></br>
<p>Yes, you will receive an email once your order ships that contains your tracking information. If you haven’t received tracking info within 5 days, please contact us.</p>

<p>My tracking says “no information available at the moment”.
    For some shipping companies, it takes 2-5 business days for the tracking information to update on the system.	If your order was placed more than 5 business days ago and there is still no information on your tracking number, please contact us.</p>

<b>Will my items be sent in one package?</b></br></br>
<p>For logistical reasons, items in the same purchase will sometimes be	sent in separate packages, even if you’ve specified combined shipping.

    If you have any other questions, please contact us and we will do our best to help you out.</p>
